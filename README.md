# Cardgame

Learning Swift from Stanford CS193p (Developing Applications for iOS using SwiftUI)

My implementation of this Card Memory Game includes:

1.Five card themes: breakfast, faces, desserts, objects, fruits.

2.Seven levels of difficulties (from 5 pairs to 12 pairs of cards).

3.All themes and difficulty levels would be generated randomly by clicking on "Next Round" button.
